# Object Tracking with OpenCV
Overview:
This project tracks an object in real-time using a webcam feed. The user selects an object by drawing a rectangle around it, and the program tracks that object across the video frames.

## How It Works:
- Object Selection: The program captures video from the webcam. The user draws a rectangle around the object to track.
- Object Tracking: The program uses OpenCV's tracker to follow the selected object as it moves across the frames.
- Real-Time Tracking: A rectangle is drawn around the object in each frame, updating its position. If the object is lost, a "Lost Track" message is displayed.
  
## Benefits of Object Tracking:
- Security Surveillance: Track people or vehicles in a monitored area.
- Self-Driving Cars: Track surrounding vehicles and pedestrians to ensure safety.
- Robotics: Enable robots to follow and interact with objects or people.
- Sports Analytics: Track players or the ball in games for performance analysis.
- Healthcare: Monitor patients or track movements in healthcare settings.
